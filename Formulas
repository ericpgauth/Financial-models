FV of single cash flow = FV = PV(1+r)^n
PV of single cash flow = FV/(1+r)^n
PV of perpetuity = A / r where A = Payment amount
FV with continous compounding (cc) FVn = PVe^rs^n
Effective Annual Rate (EAR) = (1+periodic rate)^m-1 where Period Rate = Stated annual rate/number of compounding periods one year and m = number of compounding periods in one year
EAR with cc EARcc = e^rs - 1
Relative Frequency = absolute freq of each interval/Total number of observations
Cumulative Relative Frequency = Add the relative freqs while proceeding from first to last interval
Arithmetic Mean x̄ = ̄sum(x)/N
Weighted Average Mean = Sum(wi*xi)
Geometric Mean G=(1+r1)(1+r2)...(1+rn)^1/n
Harmonic Mean HM = n/ sum(1/xi)... with xi > 0 for i = 1,2,...n "N over the sum of the recriprocals
Mean Absolute Deviation MAD = sum(|xi - x̄)/n
Percentiles = Ly = (n+1) x y/100
Quartile = Distribution / 4
Quintile = Distribution / 5
Decile = Distrobution / 10
Range = Max value - Min value
Population Variance = σ^2 = Sum (xi - μ)^2/N
Sample Variance = s^2 = Sum(xi - x̄)^2/n-1
Standard Deviation = Square root of variance value
Sample Target Semi-Deviation
Starget = Sqrt(Sum (xi - B)^2/n-1) where B is the target and n is the total number of sample observations
Coefficient of Variation = CV = Stand Dev of x/Average value of x = Sx/x̄
Skewness Positive Skew; Mean > Median > Mode
Skewness Negative Skew; Mean < Median < Mode
Probability Stated as Odds
Odds for an event E = P(E)/1-P(E)
Odds afainst an Event E 1-P(E)/P(E)
Probability of A or B = P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(AB)
Joint Probability of Two Events = P(AB) = P(A|B) x (P(B)
Conditional Prob of A given B = P(A|B) = P(AB)/P(A)
Joint Prob of an number of independent events = P(ABCDE) = P(A)*P(B)*P(C)*P(D)*P(E)
Total Prob Rule = P(A) = P(A|B1)*P(B1) + P(A|B2)*P(B2)+P(A|B3)*P(B3)+ ... P(A|Bn)*P(Bn)
Expected value of a random variable = E(x) = P(x1)x1 + P(x2)X2 + ... P(xn)xn
Variance of a Random Variable = σ^2(x) = sum( P(xi)[xi - E(x)]^2)
Portfolio Expected return = E(Rp) = wi(E(Ri)) + w2 (E(R2)) ... wnE(Rn)
Portfolio variance = var(Rp) = wa^2σ^2(Ra) + wb^2σ^2+ 2wawbσ(Ra)σ(Rb)p(Ra,Rb)
Covariance = cov(r1,r2) = E[(Ri-E(Ri)(Rj-E(Rj)]
Correlation p(ri,rj) = cov(Ri,Rj)/σ(Ri)σ(Rj)
Bayes Formula P(Event|Information) = [P(Information|Event)/P(Information) ]*P(Event)
Multiplication rule of counting = n!= n(n-1)(n-2)(n-3)...1
Multinomial Formula for labeling Problems n! = n!/n1!n2!...nk!
Combination Formula Ncr = n!/(n-r)!r!
Permutation formula = nPr= n!/(n-r)!
Prob for Random Variable given its cumulative distribution function: To find F(x), sum up values of the prob function for all outcomes less than or equal to x
Prob give nthe discrete uniform function: cumulative distribution function for the nth outcome F(Xn) = nP(X)
Prob function for a binomial random variable: Prp of x successes in n trials = n!/(n-x)!x! * p^x(1-p)^(n-x)
Expected value and variance of a binomial random variable = Expected value of X = nP; variance of X = nP(1-p)
Continuous Uniform Distribution = f(x) = {1/b-a for a < x < b or 0; F(x) = x-a/b-a for a < x < b
Standardizing a random normal variable = Z = X-μ / σ
   Approx 50% of all observations fall within +/- (2/3)σ | Approx 68% within μ =/- 1σ | Approx 95% within μ =/- 2σ | Approx 99% within μ =/- 3σ
Safety First Ratio SFRatio = [E(Rp)-Ri)]/σp Portfolio with the highest ratio is preferred
Continously Compunded return from t=0 to t=1 r0,1 = ln(S1/S0) with New/old
Degrees of freedome of Student's T-Distribution df = number of sample observations - 1 = n-1
Standard error of the sample mean (σ known) = σx = σ/sqrt(n) | (σ unknown) sx=s/sqrt(n)
