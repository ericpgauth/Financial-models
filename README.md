# Sharpe Optimization 
A commonly used measure in finance to evaluate the performance of an investment relative to its risk. Also used to measure the performance of investment managers.

    Risk-Adjusted Returns: The Sharpe Ratio provides a way to understand an investment's return relative to its risk. Higher returns might be less impressive if they come with much higher risk. The Sharpe Ratio helps to put returns into perspective by considering the volatility or risk associated with those returns.

    Comparing Investments: It allows investors to compare different investments on a level playing field. Two investments could have the same return, but if one has lower risk, it will have a higher Sharpe Ratio, indicating it may be the better choice.

    Optimizing Portfolios: For portfolio management, the Sharpe Ratio is crucial in optimization. It helps in constructing a portfolio that offers the highest possible returns for a given level of risk or the lowest risk for a given level of expected returns.

    Sharpe Ratio is defined as (Rp-Rf)/σp 
    where Rp is the return of the portfolio, Rf is the risk free rate, and σp is the standard deviation of the portfolio's excess return.
    Excess return defined as returns earned by an investment above a benchmark return, typically the S&P500 or Risk free rate/10 Yr US Treasury.
